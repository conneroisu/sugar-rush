description: Scaffold a new Spectr change and validate strictly.
---

<!-- spectr:START -->
# Guardrails
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `spectr/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `spectr/` directory—run `ls spectr` or `spectr init` if you don't see it) if you need additional Spectr conventions or clarifications.
- Identify any vague or ambiguous details and ask the necessary follow-up questions before editing files.

# Steps
1. Review `spectr/project.md`, read `spectr/specs/` and `spectr/changes/` directories, and inspect related code or docs (e.g., via `rg`/`ls`) to ground the proposal in current behaviour; note any gaps that require clarification.
2. Choose a unique verb-led `change-id` and scaffold `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and `design.md` (when needed) under `spectr/changes/<id>/`.
3. Map the change into concrete capabilities or requirements, breaking multi-scope efforts into distinct spec deltas with clear relationships and sequencing.
4. Capture architectural reasoning in `design.md` when the solution spans multiple systems, introduces new patterns, or demands trade-off discussion before committing to specs.
5. Draft spec deltas in `spectr/changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (one folder per capability) using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement and cross-reference related capabilities when relevant.
6. Draft `tasks.md` as an ordered list of small, verifiable work items that deliver user-visible progress, include validation (tests, tooling), and highlight dependencies or parallelizable work.
7. Validate with `spectr validate <id>` and resolve every issue before sharing the proposal.

# Reference
- Read delta specs directly at `spectr/changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` when validation fails.
- Read existing specs at `spectr/specs/<capability>/spec.md` to understand current state.
- Search existing requirements with `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" spectr/specs` before writing new ones.
- Explore the codebase with `rg <keyword>`, `ls`, or direct file reads so proposals align with current implementation realities.
